# stryker-git-checker

In the software testing context, one of the main downsides of the
mutation testing technique is the high processing time to execute
the analyses in large codebases. This work aims to develop an
integration with the Git version control system, allowing to perform
fast mutation tests with the Stryker Mutator framework, creating
mutants only in new changes over the original code base, improving
the productivity in the use of this technique in development with
Javascript (and friends).

This work is part of the [Lucas Barioni Toma](https://github.com/lbtoma)'s
completion of Electronic Engineering course work in the [Technological
Aeronautics Institute](http://www.ita.br).
